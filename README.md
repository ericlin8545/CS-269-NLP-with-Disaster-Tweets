# CS 269: NLP with Disaster Tweets

Twitter is one of the most important social networks that can even be an important communication channel in times of emergency. With smartphones, people can record the emergency theyâ€™re experiencing in real-time. Thus, monitoring emergencies with Twitter becomes an interesting topic. In this project, we would like to monitor disasters with tweets and try to make a real-time monitoring disaster system that can be used to help people acquire the information of disaster and take action to protect their lives.

In the task, we will have several training data that consist of information such as keyword, location, and tweet text. For example, 
| **keyword**        | **location**        | **tweet text**  |
|:-------------:|:-------------:| ----- |
| aftershock      | Oshawa, Canada | #WisdomWed BONUS - 5 Minute Daily Habits that could really improve your life. How many do you already do? #lifehacks http://t.co/TBm9FQb8cW |

With the information, we need to identify whether this twitter can reflect a disaster or not. In the task, we will need to achieve higher accuracy with the testing data of the above information.
